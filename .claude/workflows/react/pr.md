# Pull Request Workflow

## Process

1. Get the diff between current branch and main/master
2. Analyze the changes to understand what was done
3. Generate a PR name and description

## Output Format

```
PR Name: <concise title describing the change>

Description:
<2-3 sentences summarizing what changed and why>
```

## Guidelines

- PR name should be imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep description brief and focused on the "what" and "why"
- Mention breaking changes if any
