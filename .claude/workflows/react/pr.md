# Pull Request Workflow

## Process

1. Read the diff between current branch and main/master
2. Analyze changes to understand what was done
3. Output a PR title and description

## Output Format

```
PR Title: <concise title>

Description:
<2-3 sentences: what changed and why>
```

## Constraints

- MUST use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- MUST mention breaking changes if any
- Keep description focused on "what" and "why"
- NEVER create branches, push, or create PRs remotely
- ONLY output the title and description for the user to copy
